"""Parallel classification rules.

NOTE:
The detailed universal parallel engine (color vs pattern terms) currently
lives inside pricing_engine._extract_card_signature_from_title. This module
exists as a placeholder for future extraction if you decide to move that
logic out into a dedicated file.

For now, all parallel handling remains in pricing_engine to preserve the
exact v28c1 behavior.
