"""Finding API helpers.

In v28c1, Finding API integration and merging with Browse results is handled
entirely inside pricing_engine.search_active / search_sold and related
helpers. This module exists as a placeholder for future extraction if you
decide to move that logic into a dedicated file.

For now, there are no separate public functions here to avoid changing any
behavior.
