My 10-year-old and I work together to list cards in the kind of condition we’d want to receive ourselves. If a card is too beat up, it goes in our personal stash or a low-grade lot<strong> </strong>except for pre-1980 cards, which are listed regardless of wear.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PACKAGING:</strong></p><p>All cards are stored in penny sleeves, then shipped in Top Loaders or Card Savers, sealed inside a Team Bag. If you prefer one holder type over the other, just leave a note at checkout.</p><p><br></p><p>✔️ FAST SHIPPING&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>✔️ TRUSTED FAMILY SELLER&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>✔️ HOFers, ROOKIES, VINTAGE &amp; MODERN&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>✔️ CARDS YOU CAN TRUST</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>",FixedPrice,GTC,1.99,0,1,1,,1,,"Corona,California",92882,Flat,US_eBayStandardEnvelope,1,,,,,1,,,ReturnsAccepted,Days_30,MoneyBackOrReplacement,Seller,,,,,,,2025-12-21T13:00:00,1,,,No,No
